# Team Rocket Pygame Project

The goal of this project is to create a game using the pygame module in python. The game stores user and game data to a database. The game uses inputs from the player to move around a 2d environment with enemies and obstacles. The player is able to move, jump, and use weapons. The game contains a start and end screen to indicate what the player needs to do to start the game, and when they lose.
